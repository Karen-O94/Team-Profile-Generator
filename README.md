## Installation
In order to generate your team profile page, you will need to run `npm i inquirer` in order to install the 'inquirer' package dependencies as specified in the package.json.

The inquirer package will give you access to a series of prompts to answer within the command line/terminal 

Once inquirer is installed, you can initialise the application itself by running `node index.js` in the command line

## Test
You will need install jest in order to test the apps. To do this, you neeed to run `npm install --save-dev jest` and write 'jest' in the test property within the package.json.

Once jest is installed, run `npm run test` in your command line to check if tests pass or not. 

## Usage 

*Please see the video walkthrough for this application below*

After running `node index.js` within the command line, the inquirer package will prompt users to answer a series of questions based on their team. 

The application takes in the user's reponses and populates the input fields of the its corresponding HTML element.  For example,`${data.github}` is populated with the Engineer's github username

The actual HTML page is then generated by using `fs.writeFile`. You can see the sample HTML page created in the `dist` folder of this repository. 

Using the `fs.appendFile` method, a card if generated for each team member when the app is run and these cards append to the body of the HTML page. 

## Final Product
The generated HTML file should contain the following:

    - Navbar with team name
    - Generates a card for each team member with their name, their role and id
    - Manager should also have an office number
    - Engineer should have a github username
    - Intern should also a school name
